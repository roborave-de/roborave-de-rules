\section{General Information}

\begin{center}
\emph{"`Fun while Learning, Sharing, Teamwork"'} despite Covid-19 -
\\
\textbf{RoboRAVE Germany goes Cyberspace!}
\end{center}

RoboRAVE Cyberspace is the online competition of RoboRAVE Germany.

We have expanded the
\href{https://www.roberta-home.de/lab/}{Open Roberta Lab}
and developed new challenges especially for RoboRAVE Cyberspace.
Equip your robot model with sensors and program it to find its way around new
tracks in the 2D simulation.

Here you will find the most recent RoboRAVE Cyberspace Challenges
\href{https://cyberspace.roborave.de}{cyberspace.roborave.de}.

Depending on the challenge, the tracks will not be published for scoring until
the day of the competition.

\subsection{Rules of Play}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each team can submit one solution per hour, which will be played
		for scoring by the organisers in their simulation and - if
		possible - streamed live.
	\item The behaviour of the simulation depends on the hardware of the
		computer.  Teams should be prepared to engineer around this
		technical condition.
	\item Depending on the challenge, the robot has a certain number of
		minutes to complete the tasks.
	\item If the robot gets stuck in the simulation, i.e. if no progress
		can be observed for several seconds, the run may be aborted
		by the organisers. The organisers decide when to abort the run.
		In the case of an abort, the achieved partial points are taken
		into account, but not the remaining time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Divisions}

The teams of the RoboRAVE Cyberspace Challenges compete in different divisions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item ES – Elementary School: below 10 years of age
	\item MS – Middle School: 10 - 13 years of age
	\item HS – High School: 14 - 20 years of age
\end{itemize}

In RoboRAVE Cyberspace the teams may choose the division regardless of their
actual age. Each team must commit to a single division for RoboRAVE Cyberspace,
which then applies to all challenges. The division determines the difficulty
and the prize money to be won.

\subsection{Scoring}

The total score is the sum of the points from:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completing the track to the respective destination. The tracks
		are divided into sections. For each completed section there are
		sub-points as indicated in the point tables of the challenges.
	\item Remaining time in seconds. A certain time is set for each
		challenge. If the track is completed to the finish before this
		time has elapsed, the remaining seconds are added to the total
		score.
\end{itemize}

\section{Line Following Challenge}

\subsection{Goal}

Configure and program a line-following robot that can follow a black line on a
white background to a "`tower"' (TOWER) within two minutes and then return to
its starting point (HOME).

\subsection{The Track}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Tracks for practising are available at
\href{https://cyberspace.roborave.de}{cyberspace.roborave.de}
	\item Division ES – no intersection, 1,25 cm black line
	\item Division MS – one intersection, 1,25 cm black line
	\item Division HS – two intersections, 0,75 cm black line
	\item A new design is created each year.
	\item There will be a minimum of 20 cm of straight line leading into
		the tower.
	\item Home and Tower are marked by a colour-coded rectangular obstacle.
	\item The line will be no closer than 10 cm from the edge of the track
		or any other line.
	\item Advertisement, or printed instructions can be placed anywhere on
		the track surface, but must be a minimum of 10cm from any line
	\item Curves can have different/changing radiuses, but no part of the
		curve can have a radius less than 15cm for ES \& MS, and 10cm
		for HS divisions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Labyrinth Challenge}

\subsection{Goal}

Configure and program a robot that can (in three minutes) find its way through
a maze of obstacles to its destination by means of sensors (not exclusively the
rotation sensors of the motors).

\subsection{The Track}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Tracks for practising are available at

	\item The corners of the labyrinth are always rectangular, the walls
		are always horizontal or vertical.
